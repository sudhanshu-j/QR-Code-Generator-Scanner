# QR Code Generator & Scanner

This project is a QR Code Generator and Scanner application, which allows users to:

- Generate QR codes from text input.

- Scan QR codes from images or videos (via webcam).

- Copy decoded QR code data to the clipboard.

- Download generated QR codes as images.

The application leverages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide an intuitive user interface and utilizes external APIs and libraries for QR code generation and scanning.

## Project Overview

The application consists of two primary sections:

1. **QR Code Generator**: Users can input text to generate a QR code image. The generated QR code can be downloaded or shared.

2. **QR Code Scanner**: Users can either upload an image containing a QR code or scan a QR code using their device's camera. The decoded content of the QR code is displayed and can be copied to the clipboard.

This project uses the Instascan library for webcam-based QR code scanning and the QR Server API for both generating and reading QR codes.

## Features

### QR Code Generator

- **Text Input**: Users can type or paste text in a text field to generate a QR code.

- **Generate Button**: Once text is entered, the user can click the "Generate" button to create a QR code.

- **Download QR Code**: The generated QR code can be downloaded as an image file.

- **Real-time UI Feedback**: Button texts change to indicate loading states (e.g., "Generating QR Code...").

### QR Code Scanner

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image file containing a QR code to decode.

- **Camera Scanning**: The app can scan QR codes using a webcam. The Instascan library is used for this functionality.

- **Decoded Data Display**: Once a QR code is scanned or decoded, the decoded data is displayed on the screen.

- **Copy to Clipboard**: The decoded text can be copied to the clipboard with a single click.

- **Responsive Design**: The interface adjusts to both desktop and mobile views.

### UI/UX Features

- **Interactive UI**: Users can toggle between the Generator and Scanner sections.

- **Error Handling**: The app displays helpful messages if QR code scanning or generation fails.

- **Animations**: Button texts and icons provide real-time feedback for user actions.

- **Mobile Support**: The app is mobile-responsive, supporting scanning from both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for the basic structure of the app, including the form, buttons, and display sections.

- **CSS3**: Provides styling for the layout, responsiveness, and UI interactions. Uses Flexbox and Media Queries for responsive design.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles the logic for switching between sections, generating QR codes, scanning QR codes, and downloading files.

- **Instascan**: A JavaScript library for webcam-based QR code scanning.

- **QR Server API**: An external API used for generating and decoding QR codes.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qr-code-generator-scanner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd qr-code-generator-scanner
   ```

3. **Open index.html in your preferred web browser.**

- Alternatively, you can set up a local server using any development tool or simple HTTP server:

4. **If you have Python installed, run this command from the project folder:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```

## Usage

### Generate a QR Code:

1. Type some text into the input field under the **"QR Code Generator"** section.

2. Click the **Generate** button to create the QR code.

3. Once generated, you can download the QR code image by clicking the **Download** button.

### Scan a QR Code:

1. To scan a QR code from an image, click the **Upload QR** button and select an image file containing a QR code.

2. To scan a QR code using your webcam, click the **Start Camera** button and point your camera at a QR code.

### Copy the Decoded Data:

- After a QR code is scanned, the decoded data will appear in a text area. You can copy this data to your clipboard by clicking the **Copy** button.

### Switch Sections:

- Use the **Generate** and **Scanner** buttons to switch between the QR code generation and scanning sections.

## File Structure
```bash
/qr-code-generator-scanner
├── index.html        # HTML structure for the QR code generator and scanner
├── style.css         # Styles for the user interface
├── script.js         # JavaScript logic for QR code generation, scanning, and download
└── /assets
    ├── /images       # Any images used in the UI (e.g., icons)
    └── /scripts      # Any third-party scripts (e.g., Instascan.js)
```

## Explanation of Files

- **index.html**: Contains the structure for both the QR code generator and scanner sections. It includes the necessary buttons, inputs, and display areas for the app.

- **style.css**: Styles the app to make it visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

- **script.js**: Contains all the JavaScript code that handles the functionality of the app. It manages the generation and scanning of QR codes and includes functions for downloading QR codes and copying text to the clipboard.

## Customization

You can customize this project in several ways:

- **Change the Styling**: Modify the CSS file (`style.css`) to change the appearance of the app.

- **Adjust QR Code Generation Settings**: The size and error correction level of the generated QR codes can be adjusted by modifying the API URL in the JavaScript file (`script.js`).

- **Camera Support**: The camera scanning feature uses Instascan. You can adjust the camera settings in the JavaScript file if needed (e.g., to use a different camera or configure the video feed).

- **Add More Features**: You could add additional features, such as support for scanning from videos, generating different types of QR codes (URLs, emails, etc.), or saving generated QR codes in a database.
